# Tetris Game

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic game Tetris written in Python.
It utilizes the random module for generating blocks, and features basic movement controls.

## How to Play

Run the tetris.py file in a Python environment.
Use the following controls to play the game:
a: move the current block left
d: move the current block right
spacebar: move the current block down
w: rotate the current block clockwise
s: rotate the current block anti-clockwise
z: drop the current block all the way down
q: quit the game
The goal of the game is to complete horizontal lines of blocks, which will then disappear and score points.
The game is over when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

```python3
python tetris.py
```

## How to run the test case:

```python3
python test_tetris.py
```
